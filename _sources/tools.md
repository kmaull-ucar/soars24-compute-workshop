# Productivity

* **[browser extension]** [uBlock origin (uBO)](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock): ads are productivity busters whether we agree or not -- save the bandwidth with this excellent _free and open source_ tool and consider the hit ads make to your online productivity and privacy _"... uBO's primary goal is to help users neutralize [these] privacy-invading methods in a way that welcomes those users who do not wish to use more technical means."_
* **[text editor]** [vscode (Microsoft download, non-free license)](https://code.visualstudio.com) or [vscodium (telemetry free, open source license)](https://vscodium.com): everyone needs a good text editor

# Research Discovery

There are a number of research discover tools that you may have access to
on your campus, but here are some that do not require subscriptions (to search):

* [SemanticScholar](https://semanticscholar.org): exceptional tool for modern discovery tactics
* [Dimensions.ai](https://dimensions.ai): excellent tool for additional discovery; many additional features for discovering domain research
* GoogleScholar: classic tool, but has poor integration with DOI importation and can provide spurious results; often useful for finding author PDFs when publisher version is paywalled
* [Awesome Open Science (Github)](https://github.com/ZoranPandovski/awesome-open-science): a massively list of open source, open science tools, links and stuff
* [Awesome Open Geoscience](https://github.com/softwareunderground/awesome-open-geoscience): an excellent geo-specific resource that you cannot miss out on

## Scientific Workflows

* [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/): designed to promote computational workflows, transparency and collaboration across many disciplines
* [Deepnote](https://deepnote.com/blog/share-jupyter-notebooks): share notebooks more effectively (commercial tool)

## AI Tools

There are a number of emerging AI tools, not the least of which is [ChatGPT](https://openai.com).  Here are others you may also want to know about:

* [phind](https://www.phind.com/): an AI search engine for developers and great resource to help with your coding experiences
* [autogpt](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT): AI automation using GPT technology stack
* [privateGPT](https://github.com/imartinez/privateGPT): feeling like running your own LLM? Here's your chance to have a conversation with your own data DIY-style
* [open-webui](https://openwebui.com/): user-friendly open source web-based UI you can run locally for your local LLMs; it's magic, but not really

## Citation and Bibliographic Management

* [Zotero](https://zotero.org): free, very useful and low barrier bibliographic management
    * [use Zotero browser plugin](https://www.zotero.org/download/): essential, must-have tool! 
* [Mendeley](https://mendeley.com): excellent bibliographic and research management platform

# Code Management

* [git](https://git-scm.org): the open-source distributed revision control system for everything technical and upon which many front-ends are built; learning it will change your life
* [Github](https://github.com): enterprise-grade Git hosting; the "OG" of open source Git hosting small and large
* [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com): enterprise-grade Git hosting; can be [Linux self-hosted](https://about.gitlab.com/install/), but without some effort 
* [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/): one of the big three and still an excellent alternative
* [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/): privacy-respecting open source code hosting, all repos are free and non-private
* [Gitea](https://gitea.org): feeling like self-hosting? -- this open source project is an awesome lightweight alternative for DIY solo and small teams and gives you full control of your code hosting (not for the faint at heart)
