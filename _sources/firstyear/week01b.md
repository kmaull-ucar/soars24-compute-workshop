Python is a general purpose programming language.  As such, it is possible to write nearly any kind of program in it, sans some low-level hardware-based code (though their are workarounds to integrate lower-level languages like C into Python).

Generally speaking, Python is not valued for its speed, though it can hold its own with a few tricks.  Instead, its strength is in its clarity, accessibility and flexibility.  It provides a wide array of important language constructs out of the box to make a beginner feel invited, while also having a large number of advanced and mature libraries to help the professional developer feel productive and right at home.

## A Quick Tour of Python 
Python is a large and complex language.  While you may have had access to the language through geoscience and/or data science contexts, it is a _general purpose_ programming language that one can develop nearly any kind of program: from user interface applications to servers and low-level APIs (to the extent that a hardware-aware language like C/C++ may be invoked).

Python will take some time to learn fully, but there are some key language features that you must become familiar with to increase your competence.

The notebooks below will give you a quick tour of the key features of the language:

## Anaconda and Python

[Anaconda](https://anaconda.com) is a platform for Python that pre-packages a large number of Python libraries, tools and environment configurations that are useful for data science-related work.  The platform enables a large number of tools that help manage and install a wide array of Python packages (in and out of the data science scope).  It is an open source platform -- and thus the community versions are free to install and use, but Anaconda also has commercial enterprise tools that enable large data analyses at a cost.

You will want to install Anaconda on your Windows, MacOS or Linux machine using the recommended installation procedures.  Make sure that you keep your installation up-to-date by installing the recommended updates, since this will make sure you are running the latest packages and that they are optimally compatible with one another.

Tutorials to consider to accelerate learning how to use Anaconda are listed below for Windows, MacOS and Linux:

You may also hear the term "conda" when referring to "Anaconda", but "conda" is the package manager and command line tool for managing the Python libraries and packages in Anaconda, the distribution.
